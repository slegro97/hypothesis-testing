# hypothesis-testing
This Python project is a comprehensive suite for hypothesis testing, designed to handle a wide range of statistical tests with efficiency and precision. It supports both 1-tailed and 2-tailed tests, covering known and unknown variance scenarios, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, and chi-square tests. The project makes use of Pandas for data handling, NumPy for mathematical operations, and StatsModels for performing robust statistical analyses.

To ensure clean, maintainable code, I implemented a set of reusable functions that streamline repetitive tasks, adhering to coding best practices like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This significantly reduces redundancy and improves code readability and scalability.

Key skills demonstrated include:

- Statistical Models using SciPy and StatsModels for hypothesis testing
- Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for preprocessing and statistical validation
- Mathematics Modeling for complex statistical tests and assumptions
- Data Compilation and clean code structuring, ensuring efficient analysis on various datasets

This project showcases a methodical approach to hypothesis testing, making it a valuable asset for teams involved in data-driven decision-making and rigorous statistical analysis.
